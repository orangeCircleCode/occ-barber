This is the story of our uncle George, a barber in Greece.  George was known for two things; his dedication to his craft and for the serenade customers received during their haircuts.
This made for a very unique experince for all who came to Georges Barber Shoppe.

Although we may be missing the singing, when you step inside Corner Barber Shope you can expect the same personalized service often missing in todays hurried world.
